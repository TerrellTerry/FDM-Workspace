# Week 2 Notes
## Collections
- Collections Class
    - Provides functionality and methods that can be acted on a group of objects.
- Ordered Collections
    - Can iterate over the elements in a specific order.
- Unordered Collections
    - The elements have no relation to each other
- Sorted collections
    - Ordered collections may be sorted or unsorted
    - A sorted collections is ordered according to some rule imposed by the element content
        - It maintains its sorted state as elements are inserted and removed
    - An unsorted ordered collections is ordered in a way that has no relation to the element content
- Collections Nampespace
    - Systems.Collections Namspace contains interfaces and classes that define different collections of objects
- What does the collection interface inherit from?
    - The IEnumerable class
- What is the Collections interface?
    - The base interface for classes in the system.collections namespace.
    - Two key interfaces
        - IList
        - IDictionary
- IList
    - Represents a non generic collection of object that can be accessed by index
    - Ordered collection (sequence)
    - Defines methods to manipulate by position
- ISet
    - Interface for implementing sets
        - HashSet
            - Unordered
        - SortedSet
    - Sets are collections that have unique elements and specific operations
    - It does not have an index
    - Does not allow duplicates
    - Items within must obey the rule of equality
        - Check the hashcode, if it's equal, check the equality.
- Dictionary
    - Key value pairs
- Stack
    - Last in first out (Stack of plates, grab from the top)
    - Push - Inserts at top
    - Pop - Removes from top
    - Peek - Check the top of stack without removing
- Queue
- LinkedList
