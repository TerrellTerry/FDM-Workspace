# Review
- What are the primitives in Java?
    - int
    - double
    - long
    - short
    - byte
    - float
    - boolean
    - char
- How are arrays and arraylists different?
    - Arrays are immutable in size
    - Array lists can grow in size as needed
- What is coupling?
    - When an object of a class is dependant on an object in another class.
    - Coupling is a measure of how dependent one class is on the implementation details of another class.
- What does it mean to describe a class as a being tightly coupled to another class?
    - Tight coupling between two classes means that class A relies very heavily on the implementation details of class B. This means that it will be difficult to add on to or expand either class A or B. Changing class B could break class A and it is difficult to expand on class A because you are tightly coupled to a concretion rather than an abstraction.
- What is cohesion?
    - Cohesion is the extent to which elements (attributes and methods) belong together in a class.
- What are the four pillars?
    - Abstraction
        - Hiding implementation details from your users. 
        - You should hide logic in methods and classes to make your code base easier to use, and easier to expand.
    - Polymorphism
        - The ability for methods to have methods to have many forms.
        - Overriding - Ability for a child to define more specific implementations of a method defined in a parent class.
        - Overloading - Same method signature, different parameters and implementations. This is used to give your users multiple ways to accomplish the same result given different inputs.
    - Inheritance
        - The ability to set up a parent child relationship between two class.
        - 'Is-a' relationship
        - All methods and attributes defined in the parent are available in the child.
        - Useful for:
            - Code resuse
            - Reducing coupling between classes.
    - Encapsulation
        - Restricting access to attributes in a class by using access modifiers, getters and setters.
        - Maximizing cohesion by grouping related elements.
- What does the @Override annotation do?
    - This annotation means that your code will throw a compile time error if the method signature does not exist in the parent class.
    - This annotation is not mandatory, but is good practice to use it.
- What does the final keyword do?
    - Class
        - Can't be inherited
    - Method
        - Can't be overriden
    - Attribute
        - Can't change the value
- What is an access modifier?
    - A keyword that determines where a class, method or attribute can be accessed and used.
    - Public
    - Private
    - Default (package-private)
        - Within the same package and class
    - Protected
        - Default while also the children can access
- What is a ternary operator?
    - A shorthand syntax for creating an efficient conditional statement.
    - Harder to read, but useful when concision is key.
    - Useful for lambda expressions
- What is vertical constructor chaining?
    - When a child class calls a constructor from its parent
- What is a mandatory dependency?
    - When a class requires a particular dependency to function. The class requires that dependency and makes the dependency mandatory by including the dependency in its constructor, and not prividing a constructor without the dependency.
- What is the first line in any constructor?
    - Super() - Vertical or this() - Horizontal
- What is horizontal constructor chaining?
    - You can make a call to another constructor within the same class to reuse code.
# Interfaces and Abstract classes
- What is an abstract class?
    - Can't make an instance of the class.
    - Define a base set of attributes and behaviors that classes will share.
    - Solely for inheritance.
    - Can also have abstract methods
- What is an abstract method?
    - Doesn't have a method body
    - All concrete children are required to give implementations of inherited abstract methods.
    - Are used to force children to have an implementation of the method.
- What is an interface?
    - Similar to an abstract class.
    - Used for inheritance, allows multiple inheritance.
- Interface vs abstract class?
    - Interface
        - Only access modifier is public
        - All attributes are constants (public, static and final)
        - Can implement multiple interfaces in a class.
        - Cannot define constructors in interfaces
        - Cannot define concrete, instance methods without the use of the default keyword.
    - When to use Interface or Abstract class?
        - Interfaces abstract out a related group of methods and behaviors
        - Abstract used to abstract a base set of behaviors and attributes that a set of classes will share.
        - Interfaces describe something a child can DO.
        - Abstract classes describe what a child IS.
# Casting
- What is casting?
    - Changing from one datatype to another datatpye.
- Why is it useful to upcast?
    - To increase flexibility by reducing coupling.
    - Relies on a parent reference without caring about child implementation.
- What is upcasting?
    - Using a parent reference to point to a child object.
- What is downcasting?
    - Taking a parent reference that points to a child object and reverting back to a child reference that points to a child object.
- Why do you need to downcast?
    - You have a parent reference but need child specific methods, you need a child reference.
- How do you make downcasting more safe? What do I mean when I say downcasting is unsafe?
    - Create a conditional to check if a class is an instance of another class.
        - If(parentReference instance of ChildClass){
            //Logic to cast here
        }
        - Should avoid downcasting if possible because even if you prevent a class cast exception by using the instance of keyword, you are now creating a branch in logic.
    - When looping through a list, it's not inheritly bad.
# Memory Management
- What is the stack?
    - Where methods and local variables
- What is the heap?
    - Where objects and ther data are stored.
- What is the string pool?
    - Checks if the value of a string already exists in the heap?
- Is Java compiled or interpreted?
    - Both
- What is the JVM?
    - Java Virtual Machine.
    - Interpreter for Java
    - Turns Java byte code into machine code.
- What is the garbage collector?
    - Part of the JVM that reclaims memory for objects that are no longer used anymore.
    - Java is bad for a real-time applications
- What do pass by value/reference mean?
    - By value - Passing data into a method, the data is copied and the method deals with the copy.
    - By reference - When you pass data into a method, a pointer to that data is given and any changes made in the method will be reflected outside the method as well.
- Is Java a pass by value, or pass by reference language?
    - Pass by value
    - Remember that the value for an object variable is a memory address. A reference.
    - Any changes made to an object using a reference within a method will not apply to the objects.
