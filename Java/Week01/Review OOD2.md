# Exceptions
- What are exceptions?
    - Objects that are used to represent disruptions to the application.
- What are the two kinds of exceptions?
    - Checked and Unchecked
- How should you deal with exceptions?
    - Checked
        - throw or try catch blocks
        - Throw
            - Not within the scope to solve the problem
        - Try catch blocks
            - Can be solved within the scope
        - Throws
    - Unchecked exception
        - Code problem, shouldn't be caught
- What kinds of problems should you represent using each exception type?
    - Checked Exception
        - Something occurs outside of the control of your code.
            - Can be recovered from
    - Unchecked Exception
        - Problem that occurs due to poor quality code.
            - Can't or shouldn't be caught.
- What is JUNIT?
    - A unity testing framework for Java
- What is a unit?
    - The smallest testable piece of code
- What is unit testing?
    - The process of testing all of the smallest testable piece of code in isolation
- What is TDD?
    - Test Driven Development
        - A process where you write tests and write code to pass the tests.
        - Design the tests, write the code.
- What are the five steps of the TDD process?
    1. Write the tests
    2. Make it compile
    3. Watch it fail
    4. Write the minimum amount of code necessary to pass ALL tests.
    5. Refactor and generalize
- What kinds of tests can you write using junit alone?
    - State based tests
        - This means that junit can only test units that change state.
- What is Mockito?
    - A mocking framework
        - Used to create mock objects
    - Behavioral tests
        - The interaction between classes
- When do you need to use Mockito?
    - Whenever you are testing a class with dependencies
- What is a mock object?
    - Fake implementation of a class whose output can be precisely controlled.
- What is stubbing?
    - Forcing a mock object to return something other than the default value for a method.
- What does the verify statement do?
    - A method which is used to determine if a test passed or failed based on whether or not a method was called on a mocked object.
# Collections
- What are the four collections?
    - List
        - Used as a generic way to store data
    - Queues
        - Used when simulating a line. Storing data based on priority
    - Set
        - Used when storing information without duplicates
    - Map
        - Used when you want fast data retrieval
- What does it mean to be ordered and what does it mean to be sorted?
    - Ordered
        - Indexed
    - Sorted
        - Sorted colelctions place elements in a particular order based on comparisons.
- What are generics?
    - A way to provide type safety for classes at compile time.
    - Used to make classes that can be instantiated to deal with a given datatype.
